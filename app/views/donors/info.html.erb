            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              Give One is a non-profit federal tax-exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, EIN 81-4924613, so all of your donations are tax deductible.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              The money you donate goes directly to the selected charities. We don’t take a penny.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              We’re run by a team of volunteers, and all of our administrative costs are supported by private philanthropy which enables us to ensure every dollar raised goes directly to supporting the causes you care about most. Interested in supporting the platform? Reach out to <a class="accent-color text-decoration-none" href="mailto:hello@give-one.org">hello@give-one.org↳</a>, and thanks!

            <p class='faq-subheading sofiabold h4 dgray'>How this works</p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              We process your credit card payments through Stripe. Stripe takes a 2.2% + $0.30 processing fee, or 3.5% if you use an American Express.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              Due to this processing fee, we process donations on the 1st of every month, instead of charging you each day. Signed up mid-month? Your donations will be prorated.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              If you’d like to change any of your information, select a different cause to support, adjust your donation amount, or cancel your donation, just log in to your account <a class="accent-color text-decoration-none" href="/account">login here↳</a>. Any changes made to your donation amount or the cause you are supporting will take effect on the 1st of the next month.
