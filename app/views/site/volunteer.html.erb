              There are many great organizations doing incredible and impactful work. We didn’t want to spend time creating new ones - we wanted to connect with the local organizations already making a difference. To find local organizations that need volunteers, Google:
              “(neighborhood) + (choose one of our 6 categories) + volunteer”
            </p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              Additionally, your local soup kitchen, churches, and community centers are great places to start.
              The money you donate goes directly to the selected charities. We don’t take a penny.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-subheading sofiabold h4 dgray'>Ask & listen</p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              Once you’ve found someone to talk to, simply ask ‘how can I help?” Listen to their needs, and see how you can start with a few friends or contacts. Remember the power of thinking small.
            </p>

              We chose to start with two criterias:
              <ul class='faq-text h5'>
              	<li>1. 	Weekend dates, when more people had off from work.</li>
              	<li>2. 	Focusing on charities that could take general help, so as to make the
                	opportunities more inclusive for first time volunteers.</li>

            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              Once you’ve met an organization, think beyond helping out just once. How can you build a meaningful relationship?

              It can take a good amount of communication to find the best time available for the organization, and your volunteers. Patience is a virtue. Start small.

            <p class='faq-text lgray h5'>
              Community organizations are going to want to get an understanding of who you are, your motives and your credibility. Meeting in person, and mentioning other local groups you are working with - can help a lot.

            <p class='faq-subheading sofiabold h4 dgray'>Paperwork</p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              Many community programs need volunteers to fill out paperwork. Some are extensive, and if children or at-risk individuals are involved, they may request background checks.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              We looked for partners with the least amount of paperwork possible. You may still have to personally fill out information for or with your volunteers.

            <p class='faq-subheading sofiabold h4 dgray'>Organizing your volunteers</p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              For each activation, we assigned a team leader to help ensure volunteers show up on time, are professional, and organized. Be prepared;  it’s a good amount of work in the beginning!
            </p>
            <p class='faq-subheading sofiabold h4 dgray'>Supplies & transportation</p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              We decided to do a small event to raise a few hundred dollars per activation to help pay for supplies and transportation. It’s not necessary, but you may incur some costs. Donations via raffle, bingo, dinner, or silent auction can help go a long way to cover basic expenses.
            </p>
            <p class='faq-subheading sofiabold h4 dgray'>Legal & liability</p>
            <p class='faq-text h5'>
              We were fortunate enough to have a lawyer help advise us on where we, volunteers and organizations stand. It is important for each volunteer to sign an indemnification waiver before each activation. This is a great <a class="accent-color text-decoration-none" href="#">resource↳</a> to learn more about waivers and rights.
