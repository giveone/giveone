<p>Hi <%= @subscriber.name %>,</p>

<p>You've changed your email for <%= Rails.application.secrets.name %>. Now, it's <%= @new_email %>.</p>

<p>If this looks right, you're all set. If you didn't make this change or need to update your email again, you can make changes from <%= link_to 'your account page', subscriber_url(@subscriber, auth: @subscriber.auth_token) %>.</p>

<p>&mdash;<%= Rails.application.secrets.name %></p>
