<p>Hi <%= @donor.subscriber.name %>,</p>

<p>
  Oops! Looks like the credit card you used didn’t go through — maybe you typed a number
  wrong or entered the expiration date incorrectly? It’s easy to fix, though. Just re-enter
  your billing details <%= link_to 'here', email_login_subscriber_url(@donor.subscriber, @donor.subscriber.auth_token, next: edit_donor_url(@donor.subscriber)) %>.
  You’ll be a <%= Rails.application.secrets.name %> donor in no time.
</p>

<p>If you have questions, just reply to this email. We’re happy to help out!</p>

<p>&mdash;<%= Rails.application.secrets.name %></p>
